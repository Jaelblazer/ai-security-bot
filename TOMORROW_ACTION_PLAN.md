## Quick Commands Reference

cd C:\Users\atien\ai_security_bot

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run bot locally
python security_bot.py

# Test deployment script
python deploy.py
```

## Discord Bot Commands to Test

- `!help` - Show all commands
- `!setup` - Set up monitoring for channel
- `!status` - Check bot status
- `!scan` - Manual security scan

## Expected Bot Output

When running successfully, you should see:
```
INFO:discord.client:Logging in using static token
INFO:discord.client:Logged in as AI Security Monitor Bot#1234
```

## If You Get Stuck

1. **Python issues**: Reinstall with "Add to PATH" checked
2. **Discord bot not responding**: Check token and permissions
3. **OpenAI errors**: Verify API key and billing
4. **Deployment issues**: Check environment variables

## Tomorrow's Goal Reminder

**Target: $40/day = $1,200/month**

To reach this, you need:
- 24-60 Pro users ($20/month) OR
- 6-12 Enterprise clients ($50/month) OR
- Mix of both

**Focus on getting your first 5 paying clients!**

## Evening Reflection Questions

Before bed, ask yourself:
1. Did I complete all the setup steps?
2. Is my bot working and accessible?
3. How many people did I tell about my bot?
4. What feedback did I get?
5. What will I improve tomorrow?
